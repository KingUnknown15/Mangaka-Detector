# Mangaka Detector

A fun side project i'm making where i intend to make a Deep Learning model to recognize some of my favorite Mangaka's artstyle. I'm making the dataset on my own using the MangaDex API.

**LEGALLY CAN'T SHARE THE DATASET AND HAVEN'T FINISHED MAKING IT AS WELL**

Mangaka:
-
- Eiichiro Oda (ONE PIECE)
- Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball)
- Gege Akutami (Jujutsu Kaisen)
- Kentaro Miura (BERSERK)
- Kohei Hirokoshi (My Hero Academia)
- Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto)
- Tite Kuba (Bleach)
- Tatsuki Fujimoto (Chainsaw Man)
